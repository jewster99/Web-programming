Using the standard JavaScript functions, create a file tree (see Figure 1) based on the data in file structure.js.
Requirements:
-	By default all folders are closed
-	When you click on a closed folder, folder opens. Otherwise close
-	When you click on file - nothing happen
-	If the top-level folder closes when the subfolder is open, then after reopening the top-level folder, the subfolder remains in the same state (See Figure 2)
-	Use the appropriate icon if the folder is open or closed.
-	Folder/File may be clickable out of name
-	The folder / file is clickable outside the title. (It means you can open folder by clicking on row instead title directly)

Icons, to the left of file/folder names can be found at the link - https://material.io/icons/ (they are already included). Use icons like this 
```html
<code><i class="material-icons">done</i></code>
```
will display icon -> Â
